In the absence of a proper README or any documentation - both of which are exceedlingly unlikely to ever materialise - just have a look through the code. If you know PHP you'll figure it out in no time. Nothing ground breaking or even well-written happening here, it's literally for tiny, mostly static sites. If you can work out how to use it through the code then there's a very good chance you can write something better yourself, so bear that in mind, yeah?
